After the interview, 2 features have been added:
"(7) IELTS Writing Task 2 answering": The user can enter an IELTS Writing Task 2 question and a band score. The tutor will answer the question while targeting that band score.
"(8) IELTS Writing Task 2 assessment": The user can enter an IELTS Writing Task 2 question and answer. The tutor will provide an assessment and a band score.

Reasoning: 
Following the rubric of an examination like IELTS is a highly complex task. The 2 features help demonstrate the next logical step and potential of large language models in English learning.
Examinees can use them for inspiration and self-assessment. They have the potential to make the assessment process faster and more objective.
However, for the time being, they may fail to grasp complex subject matter and provide inaccurate information.
